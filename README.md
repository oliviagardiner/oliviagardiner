My name is Olivia and I'm a software engineer coming from a static media design background. I switched to web development in 2016 and I've spent most of my time working with PHP ever since, with the occasional side quest to other languages. I define myself as a backend developer but I've worked a lot with full stack. I like to tinker with python in my free time.

I'm also less serious than what I look like :)

I like to write (not only code), you can see more of what I've been working on here: https://www.oliviagardiner.com/
