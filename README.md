My name is Olivia and I'm a software engineer. Coming from a static media design background, I switched to web development in 2016. As a designer, I have a soft spot for frontend but I mostly work with the full stack. Your databases don't scare me.

I've spent most of my time on php projects. Don't feel too bad for me, php7 and php8 are pretty cool. I like to tinker with python in my free time.

I'm also less serious than what I initially look like :)
